# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-02-09
### Fixes 🐛
- **SAF Extraction OOM (Android)**: Implemented true streaming extraction using `dart:io`'s `ZLibDecoder`. Fixes Out-Of-Memory crashes when extracting large files (>1GB) on Android.
- **Extraction Failures**: Added `ExtractionException` to prevent retry loops when extraction fails (e.g., disk full, corrupted archive).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Fixed Region filter issue where combined regions (e.g., "Europe, Australia") were not matched correctly.
- Improved Search logic: search is now case-insensitive and ignores punctuation (e.g., "Megaman" finds "Mega Man").

### Added
- Confirmed disk space check implementation (providers.dart logic).

## [3.3.9] - 2026-02-08
### Fixes 🐛
- **Extraction Progress Stuck at 1% (Windows)**: Rewrote ZIP extraction to use 1MB chunked writes with intra-file byte-level progress reporting. Previously used `file.writeContent()` which wrote entire files at once with no progress updates. Restored from v3.3.5 approach with added security checks. (#38)
- **0-Byte Corrupted Files After Extraction**: Removed silent `catch (_) {}` in extraction isolate that swallowed write errors, producing empty files. Added post-extraction file size verification against ZIP headers. (#38)
- **UI Stuck on "Downloading 100%"**: Fixed extraction progress offset so it never equals exactly `1.0`, which was misinterpreted as download phase instead of extraction phase.
- **UI Freeze During Extraction (Windows)**: Reduced UI update frequency from 10/s to 4/s during extraction (250ms throttle vs 100ms) to prevent widget rebuild saturation.
- **Android SAF: Extraction Phase Never Shown**: Added explicit `phase` field to progress events (`download`, `extracting`, `copying`). Android SAF flow now correctly shows "Extracting N%" and "Copying to storage N%" instead of generic download text.
- **Android SAF: Progress Stuck at 90%**: SAF copy phase now reports byte-level progress during streaming instead of only after each file completes.
- **UI Throttle Bug**: Fixed broken throttle condition in download provider that used `_lastSpeedUpdate` (always 0ms old) instead of a dedicated `_lastUiUpdate` timestamp.

## [3.3.8] - 2026-02-08
### Fixes 🐛
- **Windows False Location Usage**: Fixed Windows showing "your location is being used" in the taskbar permanently. Caused by `permission_handler_windows` plugin registering a WinRT Geolocator listener at startup even though the app never uses location. Replaced with a no-op override since permissions are only needed on Android. ([#1289](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/issues/1289))

## [3.3.7] - 2026-02-07
### Fixes 🐛
- **Silent Download Truncation**: Fixed critical bug where HTTP streams closing silently (network drop, server reset) produced incomplete files saved as complete. Added content-length verification after every download stream loop (3 locations: regular path, SAF ZIP, SAF non-ZIP).
- **No HTTP Timeout**: Downloads used a bare `http.Client()` with no timeout configuration. Replaced with `IOClient` wrapping `HttpClient` with `connectionTimeout: 30s` and `idleTimeout: 60s` — stalled connections are now detected and errored.
- **Retry with Resume**: Failed downloads now automatically retry up to 3 times with HTTP Range resume. Incomplete `.tmp` files are preserved between retries. If the server doesn't support Range (responds 200 instead of 206), the download restarts from 0.
- **Server Download Verification (Docker/Web)**: Server-side downloads now use manual stream processing with content-length verification instead of blind `.pipe()`. Added IOClient with 120s idle timeout.

## [3.3.6] - 2026-02-06
### Fixes 🐛
- **Out of Memory on Large ROMs (Android)**: Fixed OOM crash when extracting large ZIP files (PSP 1.5GB+) on Android. Switched from `ZipDecoder().decodeBuffer()` (loads entire ZIP into RAM) to `extractFileToDisk()` (streams file-by-file from disk). Same fix as server-side v3.3.1, now applied to native Android.
- **Docker/Web Build**: Fixed web compilation errors caused by missing `DownloadProgressEvent` class and `subtext` parameter in web stubs.

## [3.3.5] - 2026-02-06
### Fixes 🐛
- **Android Download Crash**: Fixed downloads stopping at ~70% with 0GB files on SAF devices (Odin 2, phones) — `writeFuture` was not awaited on error path.
- **Extraction Freeze**: Fixed progress bar stuck during ZIP extraction — `processedBytes` was not incremented in the `List<int>` branch.
- **Isolate Crash Detection**: Added exit listeners to detect isolate OOM crashes on large files (PS2) instead of hanging forever.
- **Silent Extraction Failures**: Extraction errors are now properly propagated instead of being silently swallowed.
- **PS2 File Corruption (Issue #38)**: Added post-extraction file size verification to detect corrupted extractions.
- **Disk Full Error (Issue #43)**: Pre-download disk space check with clear error message. Catches OS-specific disk full errors (ENOSPC, ERROR_DISK_FULL).
- **Memory Leak**: Fixed `StreamSubscription` leak in MetadataService when closing details dialog during loading.
- **Cache Corruption**: Debounced cache saves (500ms) to prevent concurrent file writes.

### Performance ⚡
- **Search Debounce**: 300ms debounce on search input — reduces rebuilds from every keystroke to ~3/s.
- **Cached Ownership Scan**: Filesystem scan results are now cached and only refreshed on console change or after download.
- **LRU ROM Cache**: ROM lists limited to 10 entries with 30min TTL to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- **Image Caching**: Cover images now use `CachedNetworkImage` instead of re-downloading on each dialog open.
- **ListView Performance**: Added `itemExtent` for smoother scrolling on large lists (5000+ ROMs).
- **Reduced Rebuilds**: Merged double state updates in search — 1 rebuild instead of 2-3.

### Code Quality 🧹
- **Structured Logging**: Replaced all `print()` calls with `AppLogger` (debug/info/warning/error levels, suppressed in release mode).
- **Specific Error Handling**: `FileSystemException` caught specifically for disk-full scenarios with OS error codes.
- **Magic Strings**: Extracted SharedPreferences keys to constants.

## [3.3.4] - 2026-02-05

- **Background Downloads**: Downloads now continue reliably when the app is in the background or screen is off (Android).
- **Progress Notifications**: A notification now shows the progress of the active download.
- **About Dialog**: Added an info screen in Settings with version and credits.

### Fixes 🐛
- **Windows Support**: Fixed a crash when starting downloads on Windows caused by Android-specific background services.
- **Android Game Detection**: Fixed an issue where downloaded games were not recognized (SAF subfolder scanning).
- **Build**: Fixed build errors related to Android core library desugaring.

## [3.3.3] - 2026-02-05
### Fixed
- **Android SD Card Support (Issue #46)**: Implemented full support for downloading to external SD cards on Android 11+ using the Storage Access Framework (SAF).
  - Fixed `PathAccessException` / "Invalid URI" errors when writing to external storage.
  - Implemented robust ZIP extraction for SAF: Downloads to temp cache -> Extracts -> Copies to SD Card.
  - Added native folder picker for compliant access to SD cards.
  - Improved progress bar accuracy to reflect download, extraction, and copy steps.
